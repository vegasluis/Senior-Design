# Problem Identified
Pedestrian fatality rate is three times higher at night. Per the Traffic Safety Facts
(2012 Data), 70% of the pedestrians are killed in the nighttime (6PM – 5:59AM).
A driver can only avoid an accident if he/she sees the pedestrian relatively far
ahead. Headlights only let the driver see about 350 feet ahead.

# Current Solutions
The closest solution in the market is the innovative design Audi has incorporated
to their car model; the Audi A4 is more for personal use rather than a pubic
design. Crosswalk lighting on the street is available to light up sections of the
crosswalk once the light is pressed. Overhead flashing lights, like the Hawk
System, are also used with a set timer to warn drivers that pedestrians are trying
to cross. One tested solution is setting two posts on both sides of the street,
such that once a pedestrian presses a button, the lights turn on to illuminate the
crosswalk.

# Team’s Solution
The Pedestrian Lighting Guidance System is a more efficient way to solve
pedestrian fatalities due to poor visibility at night. The system will be very userfriendly. Pedestrians would not have to do anything different than they usually
do when crossing the street at night, because the pedestrian detection software
will control the spotlight whenever someone triggers it. The system will run
autonomously. The main detail of the
PLGS is its ability to view any object
crossing in the intersection using the
OpenCV libraries. The cameras process
the incoming images and relay the
position to the microprocessors that
control the motor servos, which rotate
180 degrees and will be able to move
the focused spotlights from one side of
the crosswalk to the other. The device
we are trying to create is optimized
more for industrial use, not for
consumer use. It does not require any
sort of reconstruction or modification
on the road.
